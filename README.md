# BUS-REPORT
Using Angular, create a bus report page that looks like the screenshot attached in bus-report-example.PNG.

Requirements:
- On a single page, make all the data from "bus-services-data.json" available to the user.
- Data can be displayed in a list or a table, or a combination of both.
- Only the names of the organisation should be shown initially. When the user clicks on the name of the organisation, this should toggle the report showing the data for that organisation.
- The first three numbers of the route variant are most important, so they should be formatted as "bold".
- Display the following bus statuses based on its deviation from timetable - "On Time", "Late", "Early", or "Unknown".
- Use colors of your choice to signify the status of the buses (e.g. green text might mean that the bus was on-time)
- You may make any reasonable assumptions in your solution, but ensure that you note these assumptions down in assumptions.txt.
